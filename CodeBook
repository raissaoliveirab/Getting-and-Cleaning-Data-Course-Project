Objects and transformations descriptions: 
features <- Read features.txt, tramsform in data frame and rename columns 1 to "n" and 2 to "feature"
activity_labels <- Read activity_labels.txt, tramsform in data frame and rename columns 1 to "code" and 2 to "activity"
subject_test<- Read subject_test.txt' using "space" as sep and trasnform in data frame
subject_train <-  Read subject_test.txt' using "space" as sep and trasnform in data frame
x_test <- read Txt file "X_test.txt" as table using column feature of features object as column name
y_test<- read y_test.txt using "label" as colname
x_train<- read Txt file "X_train.txt" as table using column feature of features object as column name
y_train<- read Y_train.txt using "label" as colname
# merge datas sets:

values_train <-  merge:  y_train, x_train data frame columns 

values_test <-  merge : y_test, x_test data frame columns 

join_values<- merge data sets: values_train, values_test 

join_subject <-  merge data sets: subject_train, subject_test 

 rename data frame join_subject column name 1 to 'subject'

values_ <- merge data frame: join_subject, join_values columns 

acc <- associate labels in data frame with its activity name

f<- merge acc with data frame join_values)

values <- merge data frames join_subject and f columns

tidy <- select columns that contains theses strings: subject, label, acc, mean, std and create new data frame

average_ <-  grouped datas by subject and acc and apply mean to everything columns creating a new data frame

write.table(average_, "Tidy_data.txt", sep="\t")
